# code-refactor

The code in the html file has been optimized to have semantic structure such as changing many divs to heading, main, etc. to allow for an organized line of code. The css file has been optimized so there are reductions in redundancy to allow for a consise line of coding. The webpage overall with the changes did not change and looks the same before the code refactor as seen in the image below.
